    "Aside from the different features available in ``plt.plot`` and ``plt.scatter``, why might you choose to use one over the other? While it doesn't matter as much for small amounts of data, as datasets get larger than a few thousand points, ``plt.plot`` can be noticeably more efficient than ``plt.scatter``.\n",
    "The reason is that ``plt.scatter`` has the capability to render a different size and/or color for each point, so the renderer must do the extra work of constructing each point individually.\n",
    "In ``plt.plot``, on the other hand, the points are always essentially clones of each other, so the work of determining the appearance of the points is done only once for the entire set of data.\n",
